1.  It's a good practice to use only one <h1> heading in each page.
    For other headings, it doesn't matter.

2.  For bold word, we can add <b></b> or <strong></strong> around the word.
    Note that <b> is actually an older HTML element, and don't have "semantic meaning".
    Use <strong> tag for HTML5.

3.  Similarly, for italic words, <i> is an old HTML element, we use <em> (emphasize) to give it semantic meaning.

4.  "Attributes" are pices of information describing elements.
    <img> or <img /> is both fine.

5.  For <img /> tag, always write the "alt" (alternative) attribute, to (1)Let search engines know what's the image (2)Blind people.

6.  <head> is for information that describes the document.

7.  <meta> (metadata) means: data about the data.

8.  To include a hyperlink to webpages: <a href="some link">text</a> (anchor)

9.  A whole elements is a mess, so we need "containers" element to group things together:
    <nav>: navigation.
    <header>: the top part of a document or the top part of some smaller unit. 
    <article>
    <aside>: for things that is not the main part (e.g., article).
    <footer>

10. "Semantic elements": A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
    Examples of "Non-semantic" elements: <div>, <span>
    Examples of "Semantic" elements: <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <footer>, <aside>, ...

11. Use "semantic" elements to have meaning to the container (box), only use <div> when we don't want to attach meaning to certain box.
    (In older HTML, we'd use <div> for every boxes, and use id="" to give it meaning)

   Question: Why semantic elements? 
   Answer: (1)search engine optimization (2)accessibility

   When thinking of HTML, don't just only think about it's appearance in the browser, but also the meaning of the elements.
