// Intro: Overview

1.  <figure>: semantic html tag, usually used for: images, code snippets, quotations, product cart.

2.  <section>: semantic html tag

3.  <blockquote>: semantic, indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.

4.  <span>: A generic inline container for phrasing content.
            It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.
            Similar to <div> element, but <span> is inline.

5.  For product carts, we can use <figure> or <article> is both ok!
    (figure more prefered)

// Colors and Typography

1.  Tools: 

    (1) Google Fonts: https://fonts.google.com/?query=inter

    (2) Open Color: https://yeun.github.io/open-color/ 

    (3) Coolors: https://coolors.co/

    (4) 

2.  Common to set button uppercase.

3. Remember to check color contrast between text and background-color of at least 4.5.

3.  Adjust the following according to need:
    (1) font-size
    (2) letter-spacing
    (3) line-height
    (4) text-shadow
    (5) color

///////////////////////////////////
// Images 

1.  Types: product photos, storytelling photos (most used), illustrations, patterns.

2.  Use original images, or original-looking stock images.

3.  Free images and illustrations Websites:

    (1) Unsplash (image): https://unsplash.com/

    (2) Pexels (image): https://www.pexels.com/

    (3) DrawKit (illustration): https://drawkit.com/

    (4) unDraw (illustration): https://undraw.co/illustrations

4.  How to use images: 

    (1) Show REAL people in image

    (2) If necessary, crop the image to fit my message

    (3) Experiment combining photos, illustrations, and patterns.

5.  Text on images:

    (1) Darker or brighten the image. (completely or partially, using a gradient)

    (2) Position text into neutral image area.

    (3) Put text into a box. (maybe add some opacity to the box)

6.  Technical details: 

    (1) To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x their displayed size.
        (e.g., if visible: 300x300 px, original image needs to be 600x600 px)

        a. Scale factor: Actual pixels the screen has / Pixels represented on screend

        b. On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens, it's 
           1x. (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)

    (2) High-res images --> large file size
        So, we should compress images for lower file size and better performance.

    (3) When using multiple images side by side, make sure all have exact same dimensions




///////////////////////////////////
// Icons

1.  Use good icon pack: 

    (1) Phosphor icons: https://phosphoricons.com/ 

    (2) ionicons: https://ionic.io/ionicons

    (3) ICONS8: https://icons8.com/ 

    (4) heroicons: 

2.  Use only ONE ICON PACK, don't mix icon packs!!!

3.  Use SVG icons (best) or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)!

    (since bitmaps don't scale, might get blurry on high-res screens)

4.  Adjust to website personalities (roundness, weight, filled/outlined, ...)

5.  When to use icons? 

    (1) To provide visual assistance to text. (to help understand text)

    (2) For product feature blocks. (describe features of product or service)

    (3) Use icons associated with actions, and label them 
        (don't mix elements of text and unlabeld icons)

    (4) As bullet points

6.  How to use? 

    (1) adjust the color of the icon to your need (stroke / fill property)

    (2) icons need to make sense with the text

    (3) If needed, enclose icons in a shape

7.  For svg icons, we can just paste the code to html file



///////////////////////////////////
// Shadows

1.  shadow can be used on text and box.

2.  serious / elegant ---> creative / playful
       less shadows   --->   more shadows

3.  Don't overuse shadows!

4.  Make shadows light, not too dark!

5.  Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out. (draw attention)

6.  Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more.
    (common used on carts)

7.  Use large shadows for elements that really should float above the screen.
    (pop-ups, floating nav, ...)

8.  Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover).

9.  Experiment with glows (colored shadows)




///////////////////////////////////
// Implementing Shadows

1.  box-shadow: offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color ;

    (spread-radius is optional, 0 by default)
    (Normally we omit spread-radius, making it 0)

2.  Can even add multiple shadows.

3.  See MDN for more info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow

4.  blur-radius: The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger and lighter.
                 If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow's edge is sharp).

    spread-radius: Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger, negative values will cause the shadow to shrink.
                   If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as the element)




///////////////////////////////////
// Border-Radius

1.   serious / elegant  ---> creative / playful
    less border-radius  ---> more border-radius

2.  Common on: botton, image, around icon, standout sections

3.  See more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius 




///////////////////////////////////
// Visual Hierarchy: text

1.  Emphasize: titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons, etc.

2.  De-emphasize: labels, secondary/addtional information, etc.



///////////////////////////////////
// Visual Hierarchy: components

1.  using: background-color, shadow border, etc.

2.  Emphasize: testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, 
    preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc.




///////////////////////////////////
// UX design: layout

1.  Don't design complicated layouts
    Don't reinvent the wheel, use patterns that users are familier with.
    
    (i.e., don't try to be original and creative, since we're not UI professionals, just be simple)

2.  Make call-to-action the most prominent.

3.  Use blue and underline ONLY for LINKS!

4.  Make animations with purpose and formats.

5.  In forms, align lables and fields in a single vertical line.
    (easier to scan)

6.  Offer users feedback for all actions.
    (form errors, success, etc.)

7.  Place action buttons where they should make an action.


 

///////////////////////////////////
// UX design: content

1.  Use descriptive, keyword-focused, headline on main page.
    Don't be vague, or fancy.

2.  Don't include fluff contents, be efficient and clear with the content.

3.  Use simple words.

4.  Break up long text with sub-headings, images, blockquotes, bullet points, etc.




///////////////////////////////////
// Website Design

1.  Check out the theory lectures pdf file for the 7 personalities!

    Tools to watch others' pages:

    (1) Land-book:
    (2) One Page Love: inspiration
    (3) awwwards: menu --> collections --> websites
    (4) screenlane: for indiviual components
